##  Attempting to provide answers to some common questions 

* The floating icon did not appear when running the game. <br>
     When launching the game for the first time, if the game lacks overlay permissions, a settings window will automatically open (if no pop-up appears, it indicates a packaging error). You must grant Azur Lane overlay permissions.<br>

* The floating icon is too big, affecting my ability to leave the game running in the background. <br>
    Update to version 2.9.0 or later, and this problem will be gone.<br>

* It keeps getting stuck on the update screen and won't let me enter the game.<br>
    You can try clearing all game data. If clearing the data and re-downloading still prevents you from entering the game, you'll need to seek help from others. There are many possible reasons.<br>

* Can you add the XXXXX feature like other mods do?<br>
    Mods are created using the Lua C API. If you can provide the corresponding source code, it will definitely be possible to add this feature.<br>
