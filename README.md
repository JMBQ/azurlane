* `Settings` allows switching to the settings page, supporting floating icon position memory (enable `Save feature preferences`) and floating icon size adjustment.
* If you can't see the floating icon, do whatever it takes to enable the game's floating permission and manually grant it.
* On some emulators, the floating window may not display properly. You may need to disable certain emulator options, such as background preservation.
